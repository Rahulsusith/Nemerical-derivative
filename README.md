# Nemerical-derivative

  In this nemerical derivative problem i have taken a equation and find its derivative upto it reaches to constant 
  
  In this problem i used numpy for calculation and matplotlib visualization for better understanding
  
  I have taken an equation y=3xÂ²+2x+1 and made a visualization and find its derivative 6x+2 visualized and made second derivative 6
